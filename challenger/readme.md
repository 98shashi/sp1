# API Self Teaching Challenges

From the commandline, run the app:
 
- `java -jar apichallenges.jar`

This will start an API and GUI running on:

- http://localhost:4567

If you visit the URL in a browser then you will see the GUI where you can:
 
- read the API reference documentation
- browse the items in the application
- see the API Challenges

## Challenges

The challenges can be completed by issuing API requests to the API.

e.g. `GET http://localhost:4567/todos` would complete the challenge to "GET the list of todos"

You can also `GET http://localhost:4567/challenges` to get the list of challenges and their status as an API call.
